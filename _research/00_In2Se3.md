### TL;DR
2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> as a novel material has shown to be an effectively water splitting photocatalyst experimentally. Fe doping and heterojunction formation with MoS<sub>2</sub> could further enhance the photocatalytic water splitting activities of 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>.

### Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting has been a burgeoning field of study due to its potential to change the world’s fossil-based energy structure; however, an ideal photocatalyst has yet to be identified despite years of research. Recent research has revealed that indium selenide (In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>) carries great potential in being a promising photocatalytic water splitting catalyst due to its unique intrinsic ferroelectricity, suitability of band structure and ability to be exfoliated into two-dimensional (2D) sheets. It is a relatively less studied material and received little attention as a water splitting photocatalyst.

This work proposed to explore the photocatalytic water splitting chemistry of 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> experimentally for the first time. Bulk In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> was exfoliated to 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> by the lithium intercalation method. Photocatalytic testing proved its water splitting activity nearly doubled after the exfoliation. In-depth characterisations, including as TEM, AFM, EPR, XPS and TRPL, were conducted to investigate its structure-activity relationship. Metal doping and heterojunction formation were used as strategies to further improve the activity of 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> in this research. 5 wt.% Fe-doped 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> (Fe-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>) by the hydrothermal method has shown the highest activity among the screened metal dopants; Fe-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> has a nearly three-fold increase of activity relative to 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. This is believed to be attributed to improved charge separation by the doped Fe3+ on 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. For the heterojunction structure, 2D-MoS<sub>2</sub> was used to form a heterojunction with 2D-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. The successful spontaneous self-assembly construction of MoS<sub>2</sub>/In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> was confirmed by TEM-EDX and zeta potential measurements. 1:1 MoS<sub>2</sub>/In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> (by weight) was the optimal experimental ratio with an improved photocatalytic activity compared to the calculated average value of the two materials. The improved activity is ascribed to the formation of type-II heterojunction as proven by experimental band structure alignment (by Tauc plot and UPS), which further leads to prolonged exciton lifetime as shown in TRPL analysis.
