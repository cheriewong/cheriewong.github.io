Hi, I'm Alan :) I am a 2nd year DPhil student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. He is supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic, Professor Mihai Cucuringu and Professor Xiaowen Dong. His research interests lie within the intersection of Kernel methods with a variety of Machine Learning applications such as explainable AI, statistical downscaling, graph learning, causal inference and preference learning. Before his DPhil studies, he received a masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Oxford.

## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at University of Oxford, supervised by [Dr James Kwan](https://www.kwanrg.org/). My research interests focus on energy-related technology, sonochemistry and acoustic cavitation. My PhD is generously funded by [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) and [Balliol College](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/).

I graduated from Durham University with a BSc (Hons) in Chemistry. I progressed to read a MSc (by research) in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Prof Edman Tsang](https://tsang.web.ox.ac.uk/) to research photocatalytic water splitting.
